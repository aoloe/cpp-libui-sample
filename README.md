# `libui` with C++

Very simple GUI C++ application using [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui/).

This sample code is a bit less C-like than [libui's own sample file](https://github.com/andlabs/libui/blob/master/examples/cpp-multithread/main.cpp) and focuses on the use of libui itself.

You need `cmake` for building.

You need to compile libui on your system and copy the resulting `libui.so`, `libui.so.0` and `libui.h` in this project `libui/` directory

## Todo

- check that `libui` is statically linked in the executable.
